    This is what you need and how you do tacos
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
    <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.`Â´</li>
